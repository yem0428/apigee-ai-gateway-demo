// Budget accounting audit.
//
// QC-DeductBudget is the only thing that moves the developer-budget-counter, and it is
// continueOnError="true" by design so a metering problem can never fail a user's request.
// The cost of that design is that every way it can go wrong is silent:
//
//   1. The step is gated on `flow.tx_cost_micros != null`. If JS-CalculateCost throws, the
//      variable is never set, the step is skipped, and NO fault is raised anywhere. Spend
//      simply never enters the counter.
//   2. If the Quota policy itself faults, continueOnError swallows it. Same outcome.
//   3. QC-EnforceBudgetLimit in the PreFlow is ALSO continueOnError="true" and nothing
//      inspects ratelimit.QC-EnforceBudgetLimit.exceeded, so crossing the cap does not
//      reject anything. The counter is observability, not enforcement.
//
// This script changes none of that. It only names the outcome so it can be logged and
// alerted on. It must stay side-effect free with respect to request handling.
