# Scenario Presets — Generated Reference

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This file is generated. Do not hand-edit it.**
>
> It is a projection of the `SCENARIO_PRESETS`, `UNAUTHORIZED_401_EXAMPLES`,
> `MODEL_ARMOR_EXAMPLES`, `AUTO_ROUTING_EXAMPLES`, `TOKEN_LIMIT_EXAMPLES` and
> `CACHE_EXAMPLES` arrays in [defaultSettings.ts](./ui/src/services/defaultSettings.ts), which is the source of truth.
>
> To change demo copy, edit `defaultSettings.ts` and run `npm run docs:presets` in `ui/`.
> Run `npm run docs:presets -- --check` to verify this file is current.

> [!CAUTION]
> `settingsOverride` is **not** cosmetic. Several scenarios do nothing without it —
> `omitEmailHeader` is the only reason the 401 fires, `useCache: true` is the only reason
> the cache demo is a cache demo, and the Tokenomics cap exists on exactly one model.
> Never copy a prompt out of this file without carrying its override.

| Description | Dynamic request routing across multiple LLM providers and private models. |
| Card override | `{ model: 'auto', useCache: false, activeUser: 'admin' }` |

**Sub-buttons** (from `AUTO_ROUTING_EXAMPLES`):

1. **Simple / Fast** — Auto: Simple Lookup
   - Expected route: `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`
   - Trivial factual lookup routed to Gemini Flash Lite.

     ```text
     What does the acronym API stand for?
     ```

   - Expected route: `claude-opus-4-5@20251101`
   - Coding implementation prompt routed to Claude Opus.
   - Prompt:

     ```text
     Write a Python function to validate JWT tokens and decode user claims.

## 4. Tokenomics

| Field | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| ID | `token-limit-toggle` |
| Title | Tokenomics |
| Category | Tokenomics |
| Badge | Pass → Limit (`emerald`) |
| Description | Prevent abuse through granular token limits on every LLM call. |
| Card override | `{ model: 'claude-haiku-4-5@20251001', useCache: false, activeUser: 'admin' }` |

**Sub-buttons** (from `TOKEN_LIMIT_EXAMPLES`):

1. **Pass (200 OK)** — Token Quota: Within Quota Limit (Pass)
   - Model: `claude-haiku-4-5@20251001`
   - First call of the minute. The quota is checked before the request is sent, so an empty counter lets it through (200 OK) — and this response is what fills the 50-token window.
   - Prompt:

     ```text
     Explain API gateway rate limiting, spike arrest, and OAuth2 security principles in 50 concise words.
     ```

2. **Exceeded (429)** — Token Quota: Quota Exceeded (429)
